Overview
========

Sociometric test are highly useful tools for study of small groups of people. In this project developed at the suggestions and indications of Mr. Constantin Lupaescu , we ( Alexandru Dan and Tudor Ciurca ) developed a simple tool aimed for study of relationships developed in small groups ( between 15 and 40 people ). It is mainly aimed for school classes but can be further expanded to different environment groups. The software is under development and available only in Romanian.

Data
====

The test data is aimed to be collected in the following form by anonymous formulars that should be handled by as many people in the group as possible. The collected data has to include for each person the name, 3 preferred persons in the group and 3 disliked persons in the group. 

Functionalities
===============

The data collected will be introduced by the study leader and it will be processed in the software. The starting page “index.php” is a menu next to a iframe that dispalys all the other pages.

Collective management
---------------------

The study leader can have more control groups and has the ability to add new groups, copy other groups and delete groups.

Data management
---------------

Data insertion is made in two steps. In first step the study leader has to introduce the name, surname and gender of the participants in the study. The second step is choosing the preferences and antipaties by a simple drop down menu. Data can be deleted or changed by drop down menus. 

Statistics and graphics
-------------------------

* The group detection detects clusters of people that get along. The functionality of this tool is a main part of the software as it can provide specific data on the group interactions. 

* For graphic purposes you can find two main functionalities: the sociometric target and the simulator. The sociometric target is an interactive 2D target in which each circle represents a different popularity. By clicking on the shapes the user can get visual representations of the relationships between two individuals. Even if it is under development, the simulator provides sequences of possible moves for the people represented as 2D shapes on a plane. However, the output differs each time as it depends on the geometrical layout of the class. Other functionalities include listing all the people by popularity.

Features and improvements
-------------------------

As mentioned before, the current version of the software is available only in Romanian. Another feature that is to be implemented is use of multiple users and data protection. The current version supports only one user established by default.
